## Business Recommendations

- Prioritize **premium mobile brands** such as Apple, OnePlus, and Samsung in metro cities, as they generate the highest revenue despite lower sales volume.
- Use **mid-range mobile models** to increase market reach in Tier-2 cities through exchange offers and seasonal discounts.
- Align inventory planning and marketing campaigns with **seasonal demand**, focusing on Q3 (July–September) and boosting sales in weak months like January and February.
- Monitor **MTD performance weekly** to track short-term progress and **YTD performance monthly** to evaluate overall growth.
- Promote **digital payment methods**, especially UPI, by offering small incentives to improve conversion rates.
- Regularly review **customer ratings and feedback** to maintain product quality and service standards.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how raw mobile sales data can be transformed into clear, actionable business insights using Power BI. By analyzing ₹769 million in total sales across time (YTD and MTD), brands, products, cities, and customer behavior, the analysis identifies what drives revenue, when sales peak, and where performance gaps exist.

The insights enable the business to move from reactive reporting to proactive decision-making by improving inventory planning, optimizing marketing strategies, and monitoring performance early through MTD and YTD tracking. Overall, this project highlights the value of data analytics in solving real business problems and supporting confident, data-driven growth decisions.
